# band-pdos-workflow-QE
This repository provides a Python-based automated workflow for calculating the **band structure** and **projected density of states (PDOS)** of materials using **Quantum ESPRESSO** and **ASE**.
Simply provide a **CIF** file, and the workflow will handle everything from structure optimization to post-processing and visualization.


## Features
- Accepts CIF files as input.
- Automates structure optimization, SCF, NSCF, band structure, and PDOS calculations.
- Supports post-processing and visualization of results.
- Modular and extensible codebase.
